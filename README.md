# iw_market_data_provider_yf

A lightweight Python library to fetch historical market data using Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`) with flexible timeframes and symbol support.

---

## üì¶ Overview

This library allows you to retrieve market data from Yahoo Finance and return it in multiple formats:

- **Pandas DataFrame**
- **Array of close (or open) prices**
- **Array of candlestick bars**

It supports a wide range of timeframes and financial instruments. It also caches previously fetched data locally to avoid redundant API calls.

1. Clone the repository or copy the library folder to your project.



2. Choose one of the following build options:

   - **Option 1: Recommended ‚Äî Use the reload script**

     - On **Linux/macOS**:
       ```bash
       ./reload-package.sh
       ```
     - On **Windows (Command Prompt)**:
       ```cmd
       reload-package.bat
       ```


     These scripts will build and reinstall the package automatically.

   - **Option 2: Manual Build and Install**

     First, install the build module (if not already installed):
     ```bash
     pip install build
     ```

     Build the package:
     ```bash
     python -m build
     ```

     Then install it in editable mode:
     ```bash
     pip install -e .
     ```

## üöÄ Usage

Import the main interface and fetch data:

```python
from iw_market_data_provider_yf import MarketData

# Fetch 1-minute data for AAPL from July 1 to July 10, 2024
md = MarketData(
        symbol="AAPL",
        start_date="2024-07-01",
        end_date="2024-07-10",
        timeframe="1m"
        margin=1
    )

ticks = md.as_ticks() # [{datetime, price, buy_price, sell_price, index }, ...]
candlesticks = md.as_candlesticks()  # [{datetime, open, close, low, index }, ...]
df = md.as_df() # For manipulation
```

Built-in caching ensures that repeated requests for the same data are served instantly from disk.
